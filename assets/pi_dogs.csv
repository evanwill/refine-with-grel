Among the great painters who shone in the world of art, during the pontificate of Leo X, was Balthazar di Peruzzi.  He painted in fresco, like the other great men of his period, and very few of his pictures being executed in oil, his works are scarcely known out of Italy.  He was employed to decorate the walls of the Palace of the Farnesina, in fresco, in conjunction with Raphael; and that palace still offers to the connoisseur sufficient proof of his great talents. Among the few pictures which he has executed in oil is that now before us.  It was painted for Leo X., and is nearly a reception of the fresco, which was in the house of the Count Bentivolio at Bologna, and has been engraved by Aug. Caracci, with this difference, that he has added the portrait of his patron Leo, with those of several attendants, among which his own portrait is introduced, holding a brace of dogs in couples.

Chichester was the third son of the 1st Marquess of Donegal and though only 30 years of age at the time, he was apparently forced to dispose of the works of art in his possession, to be followed by Fisherwick Park itself and the remaining furniture in 1808.  He died at the age of just 44.  It is not known how he had acquired his paintings, but they are likely to have come to him through inheritance.

The auctioneer's (CL) copy of the catalogue does not identify him, but it does record the sellers of lots 49-78, none of whom is likely to have been the artist in question.  We may conclude, therefore, that lots 1-48, which were the most important pictures, had belonged to the deceased artist.  His identity cannot be positively determined, but there is a strong possibility that he was Charles Grignion II (1754-1804), who had lived much of his life in Rome, and that the pictures had been consigned by his older brother and apparent heir, Thomas Grignion II (ca.1748-1821).
