119,119,24,NO,Anton van Dyck,Flemish School,24,"Born in Antwerp, March 22, 1599; died in London, December 9, 1641. At ten years of age he was apprenticed by his father, Francis Van Dyck, linen draper, to Hendrilc  Van Balen, and at sixteen he entered the studio of Rubens as his pupil and assistant,  employed by this great master to prepare black and white drawings for his pictures for  the use of the engravers who worked under his eye and to make cartoons from his  sketches. Van Dyck's talent developed with astonishing rapidity. He obtained access to  James I. through the Countess of Arundel. He painted the king's portrait at Windsor,  In the autumn of 1621 the king gave him a horse and sent him on a journey to Italy,  where Van Dyck took up his residence. Jealousy of his great success made Rome intol-  erable, and he proceeded to Genoa in January, 1624, and remained there until the next  year, when he returned home. Rubens was very fond of him, and bought several of his  pictures, which set the tide running in his favor.  After an unsuccessful visit to England in 1627, where he failed to obtain presentation  at Court for want of favor with the Duke of Buckingham, Van Dyck lived for three  years at Antwerp and Brussels, painting and etching a number of pictures which have  become famous. In 1630 Charles I., who had seen some of his work, invited him to  England. In April, 1632, Van Dyck obeyed the summons, and after he had been  presented to the king by Sir Kenelm Digby, painted his portrait, that of the queen, and  the great picture of the royal family, now at Windsor.  In July he was knighted and appointed court painter, and in October, 1633, had a  pension of;^200 a year assigned to him. During the next nine years he painted nineteen  portraits of the king, seventeen of the queen, as well as many of their children, at a fixed  price of ^50 for half and X^oo ^^^ ^"""" length figures. Living in a style of splendor far  beyond his means. Van Dyck became more and more embarrassed as the troubles of  Charles's reign thickened, until in 1638 he presented his unpaid claims to the king,  including his pension for the past five years, payment for many portraits and for four  cartoons prepared for tapestries at Whitehall, which he valued at the large sum of  j[So,ooo. These claims were but partially satisfied when he went to France in 1641.

He was the second son and third  child of Giovanni Santi and his wife, Magia Ciarla. His name of Sanzio is italianized  from Sanctius, which in its turn was latinized from the patronymic Santi. His family  name was Sante, Santi, Sanctius, or Sanzio. He went to Florence in 1504 and remained  there perhaps a year, during which he painted a number of important pictures. In 1506,  at the time when Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were engaged upon their cele-  brated cartoons for the great hall of the Palazzo Vecchio, Raphael studied both, but  especially those of Leonardo, who, together with Fra Bartolommeo, exercised great influ-  ence over him during his two years' residence in that city, which, with the exception of  a short visit to Urbino and Bologne, lasted until the summer of 1508. During the  twelve years of his life at Rome in the service of Julius H. and Leo X. Raphael  accomplished a prodigious amount of work as painter, architect, sculptor, and archceolo-  gist.

His father, Har-  men Gerritsz, a miller, and his mother, Neeltgen Willems van Suyddtbroek, daughter  of a baker, lived in a house situated in the Weddersteeg, near the Witte Poort, and  there Rembrandt was born. Having little taste for books and a strong natural love of  art, he naturally took to his work. He never left Holland, and in it visited only Dord-  recht, Friesland, Gueldres, and perhaps Cleves. With his first wife, Saskia van Ulen-  burgh, whom he married in 1634, and who died in 1642, he lived very happily, and  the portraits of her at Cassel, Dresden, and Berlin are among his finest works. They  lived in a house at Amsterdam in the Breedstraat, where he collected many fine Italian  and Dutch pictures, glass, armor, porcelain, etc. For fourteen years after Saskia's  death, Rembrandt and his son Titus lived in this house, at the end of which time - as  his affairs were hopelessly involved - if was sold by auction with its contents.

The story of the picture is that Jupiter and Mercury were one day wandering  through Phrygia, asking for shelter among the natives, but, as foreign intruders,  they received very little attention. Only a poor old couple, Philemon and  his wife Baucis, hospitably invited them into their humble dwelling, where  they served the finest fruit they could find and their only goose - which  they had fattened with so much care - with great promptitude. During the  repast the gods made themselves known to their hosts, and asked them what  reward they wished for their excellent reception. The old couple knelt down  and begged that they both should die at the same time. Their wish was  granted, and Baucis was metamorphosed into a linden and Philemon into an  oak. Posterity has preserved their names coupled together as the symbol of  matrimonial afi^ection. In treating the subject, Rembrandt has presented the  scene almost entirely in clare-obscure. A single light brightens the interior of  the peasants' cottage, the head of Mercury being in the dark and forming a vivid  contrast. On the left a fire is burning on the hearth in the background. Jupiter's  face is brilliantly illuminated ; the light also falls on his dazzling dress.  Mentioned by Dr. Bode in his catalogue of certified genuine pictures by Rem-  brandt.

392,392,92,YES,Jan Steen,,92,"""Christ Driving The Traders From The Temple"" This picture contains many striking figures which illustrate the great originality  of the artist, as well as his keen appreciation of human nature. Christ is the  central object, and has just overthrown a table at which an old Israelite has  been sitting with his desk and parchment, husbanding a strong box that con-  tains his wealth. He is represented as thrown on his back on the floor beside  his chest of money, while his little daughter tries to save the desk from a like  fate. All around is confusion. The money-lenders are gathering up their  coin in great haste ; a woman hurries her eggs into a basket ; a man climbs a  ladder to get down his cage of birds ; and a woman, with a pig under her arm  and a jug in her hand, watches her opportunity to get out of the way. A  rough-looking fellow carries a basket on his shoulder with one hand ; with  the other he holds a dead goose, and is ready to make his escape. One of  the peculiarities of the picture is the manner in which Christ is portrayed  - so different from the Italian school. The latter uniformly pictures him as  of mild character, while the Dutch depict him as a master and severe ruler.  Collection of M.

The Child, seated, holds with the left hand a white drapery that passes under  his leg and is suspended from the Virgin's right hand. In His other hand He  holds a rosary. The girlish head of Madonna, with its soft brown hair, is sur-  rounded by a golden glory encircled with cherub heads. At her feet is a bevy  of infant forms, bearing lilies and roses, while two suspend a rosy scarf, which  forms an arc in the place where in some of Murillo's pictures the sickle of the  moon appears. On the lower right a little angel is speeding forward with a  basket of roses, while beside Madonna stands an older fair-haired angel-child  in white. Overhead an angel is playing a pipe organ, and others, clustered on  the upper left part of the clouds, are playing on various instruments : a violin,  violoncello, harp, lute and a curved pipe. They are accompanying an angel  who is singing. ",,,,,,,,,,1910/04/05,,,,,,,,,Paintings by Old Masters

His pictures bear date from 1640 to 1669, and represent  fruit, flowers, vases and ornaments of gold and silver, musical instruments and similar  objects of still-life. He was a perfect master of chiaroscuro. He particularly excelled in  imitating the transparent clearness of glass and crystal, which he was fond of introducing  into his pictures. His paintings were so superior to those of every artist that had preceded  him, in similar subjects, that they were anxiously sought after by the most distinguished  persons of his time, and were purchased at large prices. They are still held in high esti-  mation. Being obliged to leave Utrecht during the trouble which took place in Holland  in 1671, he took refuge at Antwerp, where he died in 1674.

703,703,67,NO,Theodore Rousseau,French School ,67,"Born at Paris, April 15, 1812; died at Barbizon, December 22,1 867. Pupil of Remond and of Lethiere. Always in more or less needy circumstances, he was at the last annoyed  by an intrigue about the Officer's Cross of the Legion of Honor, and finally died of a broken  heart. He showed himself a true ""naturalist"" in his first picture (1826); and up to 1848 - when his works, after being for thirteen years excluded from the Salon by the  academical jury then abolished, were readmitted - fought the battle of naturalism with  varying success. With Corot, Daubigny, Dupre, and Diaz he founded the modern French  school of landscape painting, of which he is one of the chief glories. Few, if any, have  surpassed him in the rendering of atmospheric effects, in the ability to diffuse light and  air throughout a landscape, and in the power of communicating to others the deep  feelings excited by nature in a highly sensitive organization like his own.

Entered school at the Royal Academy  in 1789; studied perspective under Thomas Malton and architectural drawing with  Hardwick. In 1807 he became professor of perspective in the Royal Academy. At  this time his painting was very much an imitation of*Claude Lorrain. He visited Italy  three times, - in 18 19, 1829, and 1840. In later years, when his style of painting was  entirely changed, he disclaimed any affiliation whatever with Claude's works. In fact, it  was not until after he was forty years old that he really became a great painter. He  stands alone as the greatest exponent of color in this school of art.

What does it mean ? What wrong have I done ? I really do not know. However, it must  have been very serious to deprive me of my liberty and to be condemned to bread and water.  In one word here are the facts : Until now (as I have always told you), I was satisfied with my new position. I  had the good fortune to please his Eminence, my master. I diverted him in his arduous labors, and I felt greatly  recompensed by his caresses and several dainties. It is true there was Bazile, a tail fellow dressed in black, who  stole my nuts and teased me at his pleasure ; but, with all this he kept me company when I was not wanted in the  ""salon,"" and I preferred that to solitude; besides, he showed me some tricks with which 1 have great success ;  therefore, without being the best of friends, we live together peacefully, and apart from the sorrow of being separated  from you, my dear parents, your son might pass for a happy mortal (con tf /it us sua sorte), as says Monsignor. Some  time ago in our leisure moments, when his Eminence was at the Vatican, Bazile amused himself by wrapping me up  in a red tippet and enjoyed seeing me imitate the gestures and grimaces of preachers in the pulpit. I think I succeeded  well, because my professor seemed to enjoy it hugely. I thought it was the repetition of a new trick to amuse my  master with ; therefore, when one day he was working with another cardinal friend of his, and seeing them verv much  occupied, I thought the moment favorable to distract them, and profiting by their being absorbed in their sorcery  books, I went, without being seen, into the clothes-closet, the door of which had been kept ajar, and adjusted myself  in haste, passing over my neck the golden chain used in grand festivities ; and when I was all ready, with one bound,  and with great noise, I darted from the closet onto the chimney, dragging behind me a large sash, which I flourished  like a flag. The effect was formidable.  As soon as he had perceived me Monsignor got up with an irritated air, took hold of a broom, with which he threat-  ened me, and calling loudly for Bazile, who came like lighting, sprang furiously forward to catch me. Amazed at all  this noise, which I could not comprehend, 1 began myself to halloo; but, notwithstanding my desperate resistance, I  was instantly seized, and after being despoiled of my costume, Monsignor threw it into the fire while pronouncing  some Latin words. I was mercilesslv whipped, and trembling all over from fear, was thrown into the awful prison,  where I bewail and try to comprehend the terrible fault I have committed. Can it be because I put on my master's  vestments .' If so, why did Bazile teach me to do so? And why did the other cardinal nearly split his sides with  laughter during the scene, and look as if he thought me very comical .\xE2\x96 '  Do I take offense when, in the morning in his breeches, his Eminence makes (what he calls) hygienic movements  with a sash with a ring to it like mine, or when he repeats his discourses with gestures .'  One must decidedly believe that the greatest crime in the eyes of the great is that of resemblance.  Signed in lower left-hand corner : "" J. G. Vibert.""  Panel, 36,5 in. long by 28,5 in. high.
