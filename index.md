This workshop will delve into using GREL expressions in OpenRefine, introducing strategies and features to do advanced wrangling of your data. 
Please come to the session with basic familiarity with using OpenRefine.

For an introduction to OpenRefine (including installation), see my other workshop [Get Started with OpenRefine: Explore, Clean, and Transform your Data!](https://evanwill.github.io/openrefine-b/).

This workshop was written with OpenRefine version 3.7.4--if you have an older version, please [update](https://evanwill.github.io/openrefine-b/content/2-start.html#update-your-version-of-openrefine).
