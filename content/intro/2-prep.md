Please download these data tables and import into a Refine project:

- [pi_dogs]({{ '/assets/pi_dogs.csv' | relative_url }}) [source: export of a search for "dogs" on [Getty Provenance Index](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/)]
- [pma_cataloguedeluxeo00unse]({{ '/assets/pma_cataloguedeluxeo00unse.xlsx' | relative_url }}) [source: Getty Research Institute example]

This workshop will walk through a variety of GREL expressions using these spreadsheets. 
**The data and transformations are for demonstration purposes only and probably don't make any sense!**
Apologies to those who do real work on these data!
