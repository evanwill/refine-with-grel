Please download these data tables:

- [pi_dogs]({{ '/assets/pi_dogs.csv' | relative_url }}){:.btn .btn-outline-primary .m-1} [source: export of a search for "dogs" on [Getty Provenance Index](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/)]
- [pma_cataloguedeluxeo00unse]({{ '/assets/pma_cataloguedeluxeo00unse.xlsx' | relative_url }}){:.btn .btn-outline-primary .m-1} [source: Getty Research Institute example]

Please start a new Refine project with each file (change the project names to "pi_dogs" and "pma_cataloguedeluxeo00unse" for easiest use).

This workshop will walk through a variety of GREL expressions using these spreadsheets (look for the filenames as given above in the Exercises sections). 
**The data and transformations are for demonstration purposes only and probably don't make any sense!**
Apologies to those who do real work on these data!
