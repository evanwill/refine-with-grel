This workshop will delve into using GREL expressions in OpenRefine, introducing strategies and features to do advanced wrangling of your data. 
The aim is to introduce and demonstrate GREL so that you will understand:

- the possibilities to identify wrangling strategies for your own data
- how expressions work so you can read docs, apply and modify examples, and debug issues
- syntax to write and combine your own expressions

The workshop will introduce the details how expressions work, review common functions and controls, and then walk through a variety of examples that put GREL into action.
